## ✨ About the Portfolio

This portfolio was built with one guiding idea: *to make data beautiful, and creativity meaningful*.  
Inside, you’ll discover:

- 🎨 *Flyers & Visuals* — crafted in Canva, ready for print and social media.  
- 📊 *Reports & PDFs* — clean layouts, strong typography, and data-driven insights.  
- 🎥 *Videos & Presentations* — smooth storytelling with compelling flow.  
- 💡 *Highlights Section* — a snapshot of my most impactful projects.  

This is more than a website — it’s a *living notebook of my journey* as a future statistician, a designer at heart, and a curious human who believes that ideas deserve clarity.
